# Rainfall Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing rainfall data and building a basic machine learning model to understand rainfall patterns. The goal is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and introductory machine learning workflows using Python.

## Dataset
- Rainfall dataset containing weather-related features
- Data includes historical rainfall information used for analysis and prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Colab

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned data by handling missing values and formatting columns
3. Performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends
4. Visualized data using charts and plots
5. Built a basic machine learning model for rainfall prediction
6. Evaluated model performance and documented observations

## Key Learnings
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Basic feature understanding and model building
- Interpreting results and documenting insights

## Conclusion
This project helped strengthen my understanding of data analysis and introductory machine learning concepts while working with real-world data.
